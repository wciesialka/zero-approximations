# Zero Approximations

A quick Python script I made to test Zero Approximations. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

`Python3`
### Installing

Simply download it using `git clone https://github.com/wciesialka/zero-approximations.git` into a subdirectory or `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wciesialka/zero-approximations/master/zero-approximation.py` if on a terminal.
Download as a zip on browser or navigate to the [raw page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wciesialka/zero-approximations/master/zero-approximation.py) and save the file using `CTRL+S`
### Running

Run using `python zero-approximation.py` or double-clicking if using a GUI.
Follow the prompts, entering your function for f(x) when asked. You do not need to enter the derivative of the function, as the script will calculate the closest approximation of a derivative of your function as possible using the definition of a derivative.
Your initial approximation of x should be entered when asked for it.
`n` is the final approximation you want. For instance, if you want `x sub 10`, enter `10` when asked for `n`.
Precision is how many decimal points you recieve in your approximations. It does not effect the calculations internally.
